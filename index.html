                <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
                <p>Music plays an important role in bringing communities together and promoting creativity. However, learning music can be expensive and not accessible to everyone because of the costs associated with buying instruments and taking lessons. My IA project aims to address this issue by building a low-cost, sustainable ukulele out of cardboard and creating an accompanying website with resources to promote artistic creativity, self-expression, accessibility and sustainability.

                    <br><br> My project will involve constructing a functional ukulele using cardboard and minimal additional materials, with a total cost of less than $20. In addition to the physical musical instrument, I plan to create a website that includes step-by-step instructions for building the ukulele, as well as a tuner specifically designed for the ukulele. By providing these resources, I hope to make it easier for people to learn and create music, regardless of their skill level or financial means.
                    
                    <br><br> My project will cover three main areas: art, science, and social. For the art aspect, I will not only design the ukulele, but also make the instrument aesthetically pleasing by integrating painting techniques learned in Studio Art classes. The scientific aspect involves understanding the physics and mechanics behind the structure of the instrument. It will be essential to understand the roles of forces, string tension, and waves to make sure the ukulele has a good sound and provides an accurate pitch. The social aspect of my project will focus on accessibility and sustainability. Throughout the years in the Arts and Science program, our classes in Sociology, Psychology and Humanities have all emphasized the importance of preserving our environment and partaking in environmentally-friendly practices. Students have continuously learned how crucial it is to become more sustainable in response to climate change and the water crisis. Moreover, students have been sensitized to the enormous cultural and economic differences between countries around the world, where most children live in poverty and are deprived from the common notion of stability and personal growth in western societies. By using inexpensive materials and providing resources online available to all, I aim to make music accessible to everyone and promote a sustainable lifestyle.
                    <br><br>My project will break down the cultural and economical barriers that prevent people from learning music. Through the use of inexpensive materials and by providing public online resources, I will bring societies and cultures together through the power of music. Everyone should have the opportunity to learn and explore their creativity, regardless of their background since music is a voice for social change and will make the world a better place. <br>
